          <h3>Biography</h3>
          <p>
            Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who
            posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures
            in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100
            artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date
            from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still
            lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold
            colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that
            contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not
            commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of
            mental illness, depression and poverty.
            <br />
            <br />
            Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and
            was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an
            art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was
            transferred to London.
