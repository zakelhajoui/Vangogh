                The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch
                Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June
                1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his
                asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with
                the addition of an imaginary village

              <p>
                Dutch Post-Impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh painted a
                self-portrait in oil on canvas in September 1889. The work,
                which may have been Van Gogh's last self-portrait, was painted
                shortly before he left Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in southern
                France. The painting is now at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.

                Wheatfield with Crows is a July 1890 painting by Vincent van
                Gogh. It has been cited by several critics as one of his
                greatest works. It is commonly stated that this was van Gogh's
                final painting. However, art historians are uncertain as to
                which painting was van Gogh's last, as no clear historical
                records exist.

                Almond Blossoms is from a group of several paintings made in
                1888 and 1890 by Vincent van Gogh in Arles and Saint-Rémy,
                southern France of blossoming almond trees. Flowering trees were
                special to van Gogh. They represented awakening and hope. He
                enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering
                trees.
