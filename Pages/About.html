          <h3>Vincent van Gogh</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Vincent van Gogh</b> one of the most well-known
            post-impressionist artists, for whom color was the chief symbol of
            expression, was born in Groot-Zundert, Holland on March 30, 1853.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The son of a pastor, brought up in a religious and cultured
            atmosphere, Vincent was highly emotional, lacked self-confidence and
            struggled with his identity and with direction. He believed that his
            true calling was to preach the gospel; however, it took years for
            him to discover his calling as an artist. Between 1860 and 1880,
            when he finally decided to become an artist, van Gogh had already
            experienced two unsuitable and unhappy romances and had worked
            unsuccessfully as a clerk in a bookstore, an art salesman, and a
            preacher in the Borinage (a dreary mining district in Belgium) where
            he was dismissed for overzealousness.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            He remained in Belgium to study art, determined to give happiness by
            creating beauty. The works of his early Dutch period are
            somber-toned, sharply lit, genre paintings of which the most famous
            is "The Potato Eaters" (1885) . In that year van Gogh went to
            Antwerp where he discovered the works of Rubens and purchased many
            Japanese prints.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 1886, he went to Paris to join his brother Théo, the manager of
            Goupil's gallery. In Paris, van Gogh studied with Cormon, inevitably
            met Pissarro, Monet, and Gauguin. Having met the new Impressionist
            painters, he tried to imitate their techniques; he began to lighten
            his very dark palette and to paint in the short brush strokes of the
            Impressionists’ style. Unable to successfully copy the style, he
            developed his own more bold and unconventional style. In 1888, Van
            Gogh decided to go south to Arles where he hoped his friends would
            join him and help found a school of art. At The Yellow House, van
            Gogh hoped like-minded artists could create together. Gauguin did
            join him but with disastrous results. Van Gogh’s nervous temperament
            made him a difficult companion and night-long discussions combined
            with painting all day undermined his health. Near the end of 1888,
            an incident led Gauguin to ultimately leave Arles. Van Gogh pursued
            him with an open razor, was stopped by Gauguin, but ended up cutting
            a portion of his own ear lobe off. Van Gogh then began to alternate
            between fits of madness and lucidity and was sent to the asylum in
            Saint-Remy for treatment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In May of 1890, after a couple of years at the asylum, he seemed
            much better and went to live in Auvers-sur-Oise under the watchful
            eye of Dr. Gachet. Two months later, he died from what is believed
            to have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound "for the good of all."
            During his brief career, he did not experience much success, he sold
            only one painting, lived in poverty, malnourished and overworked.
            The money he had was supplied by his brother, Theo, and was used
            primarily for art supplies, coffee and cigarettes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Van Gogh's finest works were produced in less than three years in a
            technique that grew more and more impassioned in brush stroke, in
            symbolic and intense color, in surface tension, and in the movement
            and vibration of form and line. Van Gogh's inimitable fusion of form
            and content is powerful; dramatic, lyrically rhythmic, imaginative,
            and emotional, for the artist was completely absorbed in the effort
            to explain either his struggle against madness or his comprehension
            of the spiritual essence of man and nature.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In spite of his lack of success during his lifetime, van Gogh’s
            legacy lives on having left a lasting impact on the world of art.
            Van Gogh is now viewed as one of the most influential artists having
            helped lay the foundations of modern art.
