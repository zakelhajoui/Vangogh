          <h3>Viencent can Gogh</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Viencent can Gogh</b>(Dutch: [ˈvɪnsənt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (About
            this soundlisten);[note 1] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
            post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
            famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In a
            decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil
            paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.
            They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits,
            and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and
            expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern
            art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came
            after years of mental illness, depression and poverty. <br />
            <br />
            Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and
            was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an
            art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was
            transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a
            Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health
            and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back
            home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him
            financially, and the two kept a long correspondence by letter. His
            early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers,
            contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later
            work
